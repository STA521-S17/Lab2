# README 

To practice team editing, pushing and pulling in your teams, we are going to have each team create a git repo  using RStudio.

Open Rstudio on saxon at http://saxon.stat.duke.edu:8787 and login with your netid and password.
While this is overkill, you may create a git repo on saxon by selection from the File menu, New Project, then the option version control and git.  Enter the URL of the Lab repo in the field and the other options.

Each team member will need to edit this file and enter their information using markdown, and successfully push, pull and merge by the end of lab!  Each team should designate a Team Maintainer  (this could be your most experienced github user).
